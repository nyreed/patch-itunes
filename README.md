# Install iTunes on Modern Version of MacOS

##Script to install 12.9.5.5 on modern versions of MacOS _WITHOUT_ disabling SIP.

A simple script to download and install the latest version of iTunes, and patch it to run on modern version of MacOS and M1 Processors.

This is complicated because:

1. The only official place to download it is bundled with the MacOS 10.14.6 updater.  
2.	The app binary itself uses executable_path expansion to link to its bundled gracenote libraries. This causes Arm macs to forbid the code to run due to their security model.

Tools like Retroactive suggest a need to disable SIP to get around this problem. This is disadvantageous because it is arguably less secure, and it prevents iOS apps running via catalyst.
By patching the binary you avoid needing to disable SIP.

###This script will simply

1. Download MacOS 10.14.6 updater (5.54GB)"
2. Extract the iTunes.app bundle from the updater."
3. Patch the app to refer link to the OS bundled gracenote libraries with Absolute path instead.
4. Codesign the patched application (mandatory for ARM macs)."
5. Install the app into /Applications."

### NOTE

For whatever reason, iTunes will NOT RUN if the following file is not present.

	~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl

It does not need to be a valid iTunes library, something just needs to be present.
If not, iTunes will instead attempt to create iTunes Library files in ~/.Trash, and crash with a "deny(1) file-write-data" error.
I have no idea why.  

Additionally, if the following files are not present, iTunes will crash on first run, but will create these files, and then run fine the second time.

	~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library Extras.itdb	~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library Genius.itdb


## Usage

	git clone https://github.com/nyreed/patch-itunes
	cd patch-itunes
	./patch-itunes

follow the prompts.

## Tested
Script tested on Monterey 12.5.1 in an M1 VM and 12.6.2 on an M1 mac, and 12.6 on an intel mac.

"An unknown error occured -42408" on startup, I think relating to iTunes Store connectivity (which isn't working)

iTunes (if it runs)
Working: Playing Music  
Not Working: iTunes Store, Update Genius.  
Not Tested: Anything else.


## Issues.

The update is packaged in an 8GB archive in Apple's proprietary pbzx format.
(it's actually a pbzx archive inside a disk image inside a xar archiveâ€¦)
This format has no index and no way to easily extract specified files.
Unfortunately this script currently traverses the whole thing, even thought the desired files are right at the beginning of the archive.
I don't know the best way to terminate the process after the itunes files are extracted.

### Why?

I don't know. I liked to sort by iTunes library by "Date Added". When I tried to import my library into the new Music app, that data is lost.

## Thanks

Bundled the pbzx tool fork from [https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pbzx](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/pbzx)
